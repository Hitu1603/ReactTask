# Getting Started with Your React Project

This project was initialized using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In your project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\
The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you need full control over the configuration, you can `eject` the default setup. This command copies all configuration files and dependencies like webpack, Babel, and ESLint into your project, giving you complete control over them. All commands except `eject` will continue to work, but they will now reference your copied scripts. Proceed with caution!
